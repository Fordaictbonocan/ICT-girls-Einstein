	 <p style="position: absolute; text-align: justify; left: 23%; top: 270px;">Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. 
	 Her father decides to take a shortcut and stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, 
	 which Chihiro's father insists on exploring despite his daughter's protests. They find a restaurant stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents 
	 begin to eat. While exploring alone, Chihiro finds a bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to leave. However, 
	 Chihiro discovers that her parents have become pigs,and the exit is blocked. Haku finds Chihiro and leads her toward the bathhouse. She sees several 
	 animals and creatures visiting the bathhouse, as well as No-Face (Kaonashi È°îÁÑ°„Åó), a masked spirit. Haku instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse
	 's boiler-man, Kamaji, a y≈çkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji says that he already has enough susuwatari to help him. After Chihiro tries to help but
	 inadvertently causes some disruption, Kamaji asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse. Lin leads her to the top
	 floor to find the witch.</p>
	 <p>Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but Chihiro persists. Eventually, Yubaba reveals she took an oath to give work to anyone who asksfor it, and gives Chihiro a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name (ÂçÉÂ∞ã), renaming her Sen (ÂçÉ). Haku reveals he is also working for Yubaba, and takes her back downstairs.
	 The bathhouse workers dislike Sen, but give her work as Lin's assistant. Later that night, when Yubaba leaves, Haku finds Sen and shows her her parents,who are being held in pigpens. Haku explains 
	 that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world. Sen is ostracized by the other workers. While working, she invites No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer.The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen‚Äôs first customer. Sen discovers a bicycle handle sticking out of him, and the workers help to remove the bicycle and a large amount of garbage. He gives
	 her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it before swallowing him. He demands food from the  bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers.	 Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When he crashes into Yubaba's 
	 penthouse with grievous injuries, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami stows away on her back.No-Face is given large amounts of food, but soon begins eating more workers. In the penthouse, the stowaway shikigami shapeshifts into Yubaba's sister Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse. Sen, Haku and Boh fall into the boiler room. Sen feeds Haku part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit 
	 up a seal he stole, saving him from its deadly curse.</p>

	 <h2>Characters</h2>
	 <h3>Ogino Chihiro (ËçªÈáé ÂçÉÂ∞ã) / Sen (ÂçÉ)</h3>
	 <p>Voiced by:Rumi Hiiragi(Japanese); Daveigh Chase (English)</p>
     <p style="width: 1300px;">Chihiro is a ten-year-old girl who has brown hair, brown eyes, and rosy cheeks. She is very petite and has a childish appearance, and a pudgy face. Her attire includes a white medium-sleeved T-shirt with bright green stripes,
	 bright red shorts, white socks and sunshine yellow velcro sneakers. While working in the bath house, she is barefoot and wears a coral colored kariginu robe with a white hitoe underneath and short sashinuki trousers, as well as a
	 tasuki cord for tying her sleeves up.</p>
     <p style="width: 1300px;">Chihiro's growth into a capable individual is a core factor to the movement of Spirited Away's plot. During her adventure in the Spirit World, she matures from an easily scared girl with a childlike personality to match 
	 her age to a hard-working, responsible, and brave young girl who has learned to put her fears aside for those she cares for. To protect her friends and rescue her parents from a spell that has turned them into livestock, Chihiro
	 sheds her former personality and adapts to her environment to become a courageous, caring, quick-witted and reliable girl.</p>
	 
	 <h3>Haku („Éè„ÇØ) / Nigihayami Kohakunushi (È•íÈÄüÊ∞¥Â∞èÁôΩ‰∏ª)</h3>
	 <p>Voiced by:Miyu Irino(Japanese); Jason Marsden(English)</p>
	 <p style="width: 1300px;">Haku appears to be around 12 years old in physical age. He has straight, dark green hair in a bob haircut and slanted, green eyes.
      When he is human, Haku wears a traditional white robe that resembles closely a Kariginu tied with a lavender sash, a short traditional indigo 
      dyed Sashinuki (a type of kuribakama) underneath, and beige sandals. A darker blue Hitoe can be seen from the sides and shoulders of the robes.</p>
	  
	  <p style="width: 1300px;">Haku first appears when Chihiro Ogino is on the bridge to the Bathhouse. At this, he quickly tells to her to get out of the town and get back across
	  the river before nightfall. But when Chihiro fails to do this, she runs off in a panic. Haku then goes to search for her and when Chihiro realizes she
	  is becoming invisible, he gives her something to eat so she won't disappear. Haku then unbinds her when her legs become stuck and takes her to the bath
	  house. Then, he helps her cross the bridge and in the garden outback, he tells her that she needs to get a job to survive from Kamajƒ´, the boiler man.</p>
